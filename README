ParseTargs provides a compact and easily updated training dataset suitable for bioinformatic solubility prediction.

The primary data source is the TargetDB project hosted at http://targetdb.org

-------
To run the update manager:

- Start the server (CherryPy) type './parseTargs' at the command line

- Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080/parseTargs
------
To update the www website 

After running the update manager, run make_www.py

Notes
-----

Specific steps in the parseTargs pipeline are as follows:-

1. Stream (SAX) the full database xml download 'targetsV2.xml' maintained at http://targetdb.org 
2. Classify target sequence as soluble vs insoluble according to criteria set out by Smialowski et al.
3. Classify target sequence as cytoplasmic vs membrane via the hidden Markov method of Krogh et al.
4. Extract coarse features of the sequence relevant to solubility prediction. 
5. Write to lightweight database (currently sqlite3)
